v2.5
Added a fix for The Washington Post links.

Various bug fixes.
Chinese Traditional translations are added. Thanks Goldie Lin!

<strong>Tip:</strong> Did you know that you can set OLW as a browser. With this feature, you don't need to share links. All link clicks will go through OLW, links will be un-shortened and will be open with the corresponding native apps. Go to Advanced to enable.
