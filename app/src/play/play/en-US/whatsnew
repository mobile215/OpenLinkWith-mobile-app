v2.5

Chinese Traditional translations are added. Thanks Goldie Lin!

Various bug fixes.

v2.3 - New advanced feature:

Setting OLW as a browser. With this feature, you don't need to share links. All link clicks will go through OLW, links will be un-shortened and will be open with the corresponding native apps.

This feature is disabled by default. Please go to Advanced section and enable.
