v2.1

Fixes with Browser selection.

v2.0

NEW! Browser selection:

When a link shared with Open Link With, browsers are suggested in addition to the native apps. This behavior can now be modified.

- None will never suggest browsers
- Always ask will include all browsers (previous behavior)
- Single browser will suggest only that selection
